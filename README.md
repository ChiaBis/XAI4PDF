README: XAI4PDF, July 2024.

The XAI4PDF project is a set of Python analysis modules which produce
the results of Explainable AI Classification for Parton Density Theory; 
the code is developed by the authors of that study Brandon Kriesten, 
Jonathan Gomprecht, and T.J. Hobbs. Questions should be referred 
to bkriesten@anl.gov and/or tim@anl.gov.

The current package includes the ResNet-like model architecture in
resnet_model.py. There are two Jupyter notebooks, one of which named
flavor_classifier_analysis.ipynb which contains the results of XAI4PDF
for flavor classification as discussed in the manuscript. The second
Jupyter notebook named pheno_classifier_analysis.ipynb contains XAI4PDF
for classification of phenomenological fits. Given the large file sizes,
we do not include training data, but users can generate this information
themselves; it is also available on request from the authors.
